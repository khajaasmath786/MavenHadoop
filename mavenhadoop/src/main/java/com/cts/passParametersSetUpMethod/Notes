Setup is called once per mapper but cleanup method is called only once for entire map-reduce
so if 100 mappers then it is called 100 times


Pass parameter to configuration object in Setup code instead of passing parameter to command line
use SetUp and cleanUp methods to access parameter.

Same approach is used while passing from command line using tool runner.
Get method from configuration object will be same


--------------------------------------------------------------
ToolRunner is best approach to register driver 

It is used to pass the properties or configuration from command line
Set the properties for DistributedCahe from command line

-D
-Conf
-fs

Example : WordCount.class  -D fs.defaultFS=somevalue input output

 --> ToolRunner class should Extends Configured and Implements tool  *** MyTool extends Configured Implements Tool
 -->All the logic of driver is present in ***** public int run(String args[]) method
